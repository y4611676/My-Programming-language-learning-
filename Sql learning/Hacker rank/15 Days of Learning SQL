/*Julia conducted a 15 days of learning SQL contest. 
The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least 1 submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. 
If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. 
The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.

Input Format

The following tables hold contest data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

Column | Type
hacker_id | Integer
name | String

Submissions: The submission_date is the date of the submission, submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, and score is the score of the submission. 

Column | Type
Submission_data | Data
Submission_id | Integer
hacker_id | Integer
score | Integer*/

---Code
select 
submission_date ,

( SELECT COUNT(distinct hacker_id)  
 FROM Submissions s2  
 WHERE s2.submission_date = s1.submission_date AND   
 (SELECT COUNT(distinct s3.submission_date) FROM      
 Submissions s3 WHERE s3.hacker_id = s2.hacker_id AND s3.submission_date < s1.submission_date) 
 = dateDIFF(s1.submission_date , '2016-03-01')) ,

(select hacker_id  from submissions s2 where s2.submission_date = s1.submission_date 
group by hacker_id order by count(submission_id) desc , hacker_id limit 1) as tophacker,

(select name from hackers where hacker_id = tophacker)
from 
(select distinct submission_date from submissions) s1
group by submission_date;
