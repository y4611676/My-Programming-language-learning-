You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

code：
select case
when P is null then concat(N, ' Root')
when N in (select distinct P from BST) THEN concat(N, ' Inner')
else concat(N, ' Leaf')
end
from BST
order by n;

output：
1 Leaf
2 Inner
3 Leaf
4 Inner
5 Leaf
6 Inner
7 Leaf
8 Leaf
9 Inner
10 Leaf
11 Inner
12 Leaf
13 Inner
14 Leaf
15 Root
