Q：Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. 
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Step 1:
Create a virtual table in your head of the data given to us.

SELECT
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS

Step 2:
Create an index column with respect to occupation as "RowNumber".
Notice from the image, under professor column, the first Name is indexed as 1, the next name "Birtney" as 2. That is what I mean by index w.r.t occupation.
The below code will only give the "RowNumber" column, to get the result like in image proceed to step 3.

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;

SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber

FROM OCCUPATIONS
Step 3:
Combine the result from step 1 and step 2:

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;

SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
        case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
        case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
        case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
        case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor

FROM OCCUPATIONS

Step 4:
Now, Order_by name then Group_By RowNumber.

Using Min/Max, if there is a name, it will return it, if not, return NULL.

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor)
from(
  select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
            when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
            when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
            when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
  from OCCUPATIONS
  order by Name
	) temp
group by RowNumber;

temp means temperaliry 
@ means make the data list become a variables


result：

Aamina Ashley Christeen Eve
Julia Belvet Jane Jennifer
Priya Britney Jenny Ketty
NULL Maria Kristeen Samantha
NULL Meera NULL NULL
NULL Naomi NULL NULL
NULL Priyanka NULL NULL
