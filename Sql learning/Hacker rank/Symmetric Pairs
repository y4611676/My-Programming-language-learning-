You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

Column | Type
X | Integer
Y | Integer

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 ≤ Y1.

Code：
SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions f1
INNER JOIN Functions f2 ON f1.X=f2.Y AND f1.Y=f2.X
GROUP BY f1.X, f1.Y
HAVING COUNT(f1.X)>1 or f1.X<f1.Y
ORDER BY f1.X ;

Output (stdout)
2 24
4 22
5 21
6 20
8 18
9 17
11 15
13 13
