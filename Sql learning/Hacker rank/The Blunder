Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error, and round it up to the next integer.

code：SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;

CEIL(數值);CEIL()、CEILING() 函數是用來無條件進入數值。
MySQL 函數名稱是用 CEIL()；Oracle 一樣用 CEIL()；SQL Server 則是用 CEILING()。

ex,
SELECT CEIL(-2.1), CEIL(2.1);

replace the str3 with str2 in str1
Replace (str1, str2, str3)
