The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

select round(sum(lat_n),2), round(sum(long_w),2)
from station;

Output (stdout)

round(number, decimals(小樹點後幾位要保留), operation)

number	Required. The number to be rounded
decimals	Required. The number of decimal places to round number to 
operation	Optional. If 0, it rounds the result to the number of decimal. If another value than 0, it truncates the result to the number of decimals. Default value is 0

CODE：
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N), 4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;

Output
38.8526

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points p1 and p2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

CODE
SELECT ROUND(MAX(lat_n)-MIN(lat_n) + MAX(long_w)-MIN(long_w) ,4)
FROM STATION;

 Output
259.6859

Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean Distance between points p1 and p2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

CODE
SELECT 
   ROUND(SQRT(
      POWER(MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N), 2)+
      POWER(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W), 2)
      ), 4)
FROM STATION;

A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

CODE：
Select round(S.LAT_N,4) MEDIAN 
from station S 
where 
  (select count(Lat_N) 
   from station 
   where Lat_N < S.LAT_N ) 
  = (select count(Lat_N) 
     from station 
     where Lat_N > S.LAT_N);
