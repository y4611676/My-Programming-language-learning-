We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings.
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

code：
select (salary * months)as earnings ,count(*) 
from employee 
group by 1 
order by earnings desc 
limit 1;
