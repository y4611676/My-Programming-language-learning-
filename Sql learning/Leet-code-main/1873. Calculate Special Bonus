Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id./*

(SELECT employee_id, salary as bonus from Employees where employee_id%2<>0 and name not like 'M%'
union
SELECT employee_id, 0 as bonus from Employees where employee_id%2=0 or name like 'M%') e
order by employee_id;

--or
select employee_id,if(mod(employee_id,2)=1 and name not like "M%",salary,0) as bonus from employees
order by employee_id;

--or
Select employee_id, (Case When employee_id % 2 = 0 Then salary = 0
                         When name like 'M%' Then salary =0
